-Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The app I developed is a weight tracking app, which users can use to help reach their goal weight. The app was designed to give users a place to keep track of their weight progress. Users can set a goal, enter daily weights and get notified when accomplished. 

-What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
To create a UI for this app I needed four main pages, the weight data page, weight upload page, login/account page and notifications page. When designing the app I wanted to keep the design simple and easy to navigate. 

-How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
I first started by addressing the goal of the application, and users use cases. From there I began coming up with a UI design and implementing that design, creating the layout of the application. From there I then began to implement functionality. 

-How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
Testing is a very important step of the process to ensure everything is functional for the users. I tested my app by going through all the functionality and ensuring the implemented features are functioning properly, it's important to test every scenario. 

-Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
For me the biggest challenge was actually implementing the functionality. These technologies were very new to me and it took some time to learn. I also would have liked to devote more time to development as I was not able to get the app functioning properly. 

-In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
I was able to successfully implement the login for the application, I was also able to display data. I will definitely be spending more time learning Java and Android Studio so I can become more confident.
